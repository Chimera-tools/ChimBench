# ChimBench
**Benchmark a set of predicted chimeric exonic junctions with respect to a set of reference chimeric exonic junctions**

From a set of reference chimeric exonic junctions, a set of predicted chimeric exonic junctions, and an underlying annotation, produces a report including sensitivity and precision of the predicted set with respect to the reference set, both at the junction and at the gene level, together with other useful numbers and files.

To clone the repository do:
git clone https://github.com/Chimera-tools/ChimBench.git

Running Bash/benchmark_chimeric_junction_better.sh will provide usage
